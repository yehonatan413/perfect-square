# About
This is my first browser-based game, it's inspired by years of messing around with the file selection box in windows.

# How to Play
Click and drag the mouse to draw a rectangle and release to confirm. If the border is red that means it's too small.
The goal is to draw a perfect square (where the width exactly matches the height).
Click the button on the bottom right to view stats.

### Arcade Mode
In Arcade Mode, your goal is to draw as many perfect squares as you can within 30 seconds.
